##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backend
After cloning, import all the dependencies and do a maven clean install.
If for some reason clean install does not work, make sure that your IDE uses jdk 11.
If you dont have jdk 11 installed, download it from **[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).**

###### Installing mssql server with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
Depending on the OS you are using you need to install the correct version of SQL Server Management Studio. For Windows 7 the latest supported version is SQL Server 2014 Management Studio. Link from the official download page [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42299).
Note that during installation for Sql Express, for the instance name it would be best if you enter "localhost" without the quotes, and do a mixed mode with a strong password which will be later used to connect via management studio.
Detailed Instructions are available on this [link](https://www.sqlshack.com/how-to-install-sql-server-2014-management-studio/), and this link [here](https://www.eukhost.com/kb/how-to-install-microsoft-sql-server-express-2014/).

For Windows 10 you can install the latest SSMS from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)

###### Creating the mssql server connection with Docker

This section is in case you were restricted to create your own connection and database via mssql studio.
If you opted for creating the database via Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and it went successfull then skip this entire section here.

---
If you have an older computer or dont have Windows 10 its better to skip this docker setup since various complicated issues may appear during installation and rely to MSSQL server section explained above.

Depending on your OS you can follow the instructions to download and install Docker on this link **[here](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)**
If any issues appear during installation troubleshoot them or skip to DB setup without docker.

Once you verified that docker is successfully installed, now we will need to setup the mssql server connection. For that you need to open the online-shop project, navigate to \online-shop-application\src\main\resources, open the .env file, and set the SA_PASSWORD.

Then from the terminal inside IntelliJ also navigate to the same location \online-shop-application\src\main\resources and execute the following command:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
After a few moments you should see something like this in this console:
```sh
 Starting up database 'tempdb'.
2020-10-12 11:52:20.86 spid10s     The tempdb database has 2 data file(s).
2020-10-12 11:52:20.88 spid28s     The Service Broker endpoint is in disabled or stopped state.
2020-10-12 11:52:20.88 spid28s     The Database Mirroring endpoint is in disabled or stopped state.
2020-10-12 11:52:20.89 spid28s     Service Broker manager has started.
2020-10-12 11:52:20.90 spid8s      Recovery is complete. This is an informational message only. No user action is required.
```
That means that the connection is setup correctly with the password you specified in the .env file. 

##### Creating the database
Assuming you have successfully created the mssql connection, next we need to create the database. For that we will open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and will connect to our new connection with the following properties:

Server name: localhost\
Authentication: SQL Server Authentication\
Login: sa\
Password: <yourPassword> \
*The password is the one you entered in the .env file*

After you are successfully connected, then you expand the localhost, do a right click on Databases -> New database and in the window that will popup in the Database name field enter **online_shop** and click Ok. Now do a right click again on the Databases in the left sidebar and click refresh in order to see that the online_shop database is really created.

Note that you might need to configure the TCP/IP to enabled and the port to 1433 which is explained in details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-a-server-to-listen-on-a-specific-tcp-port?view=sql-server-ver15)

Now we need to populate our database with the test data.
For that I've already created a db migration tool. But if you try to run it you will see that it fails.
Thats because we havent set up the jdbc connection yet and if you open application-dev.properties you can see everything is defined we just need to provide the values for the fields in curly braces {}.
Now in the top bar you should see the DbMigrationApplication and click on it to edit the configuration. There we need to set up the Environment variables.

>db.name=online_shop;db.username=sa;db.password=<your-encrypted-password>;encryption.key=<your-encryption-key>
>
So online_shop is the db name we created in previous steps, sa is the default username that we created during the sql server connection installing.
You might wonder now how to get the encrypted password. Well I have added a test in my code for this.
Navigate to EncryptDbPasswordTest class, set the ENCRYPTION_KEY to the value you entered in the environment variables above, and enter your db connection password (that you set during installation of the mssql server) in the field DB_PASSWORD. Now you are set and you need to run the encryptPassword() test. With that you should receive your encrypted password in the console window in the IDE.
Copy and paste that value in the environment variables for the field db.password and you should be completely fine to run the db migration now.

You should see something like this in the console which means the migration run successfully, and if you open the database via sql management studio you should see the new tables there as well.

```sh
2020-10-12 17:12:32.529  INFO 9232 --- [           main] c.s.o.s.f.service.DbMigrationService     : === Data migration - FINISH ===
2020-10-12 17:12:32.529  INFO 9232 --- [           main] c.s.o.s.f.app.DbMigrationApplication     : The DB migration finished with the DB updates.
2020-10-12 17:12:32.537  INFO 9232 --- [       Thread-2] o.s.s.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor  : Shutting down ExecutorService 'applicationTaskExecutor'
2020-10-12 17:12:32.538  INFO 9232 --- [       Thread-2] j.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean : Closing JPA EntityManagerFactory for persistence unit 'default'
2020-10-12 17:12:32.543  INFO 9232 --- [       Thread-2] com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource       : HikariPool-1 - Shutdown initiated...
2020-10-12 17:12:32.555  INFO 9232 --- [       Thread-2] com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource       : HikariPool-1 - Shutdown completed.

Process finished with exit code 0

```

Now the last thing to do is to copy all those environment variables from the DbMigrationApplication to the OnlineShopApplication which is in another module and it starts the shop application.
